debug release!

to build go to workspace_profilemanager and run scrip cmake_script.sh (newest version of cmake neccesary!)
in folder workspace_profilemanager/exec you will find both executables

#cmake_eclipse_script.sh is not yet working, eclipse project needs to be set up manually#

Profile Manager and Profile Manager Test are my extensions/rework of the Martin Leisener PoC
Most of needed info can be found here:

Profile Manager is utilizing:
CommonAPI Dbus communication generated via Franca code generation from .fidl files,
Async communication,
Simple timeout mechanisms,
set and unset User,
register and unregister User,

Profile Manager Test runs a test sequence:
please use Sdedit software to view results (just copy paste results into soft downloaded from: http://sdedit.sourceforge.net/)
If a test sequence for some reasons freezes, rerun it :)



Common API specification:

Common API instalation (Very old guide ....):

If you have problem with the CommonAPI, write me mail, I will try to help you :)


Below I've written my Eclipse settings, i hope it will help you

I use the Eclipse Kepler (most recent version) with CDT and gcc v4.8 configured as following:
compiler:
g++ -pthread -std=c++11

in GCC C++ Compiler>Includes
/usr/local/include/CommonAPI-2.1
/usr/local/include/dbus-1.0
/usr/local/lib/dbus-1.0/include
"${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/include}"
"${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/src-gen}"
"${workspace_loc:/ProfileManager/src}"

linker:
g++ -pthread -std=c++11 -L/usr/local/lib

Libraries:
CommonAPI
CommonAPI-DBus
dbus-1
pthread

For ProfileManager and ProfileManagerTest create separate projects (with similar config).
First start ProfileManager, than ProfileManagerTest. The test results are in output of ProfileManagerTest - copy paste it into sdedit too visualize results.

If the code builds, but you have error during run you have to: 
before running Eclipse (each time!) write commands
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib/"
~/Downloads/eclipse/eclipse               #(or your path to eclipse)

ProfileManager needs proper config, currently config is created with ProfileManagerTest.
Please copy this config mannualy to the same folder where is ProfileManager executable
